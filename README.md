# OpenSketch_AR_Painter
This project utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to enable real-time hand gesture-based drawing on a digital canvas using a webcam. Users can interact with on-screen elements using their index finger to select colors, modify line thickness, and erase drawingsâ€”completely touch-free.
